# pro_sociaal
This project was made as part of an IronHack project week with Emad Ghnim and Yann Quintin.

# Project's objective
This project was built after 5 weeks of classes ranging from basic CSS, HTML, Javacrsipt along with Back-End practices.

Its requirements were to create a back-end which utilizes CRUD methods, created GET and POST routes to browse the app. It also required one or several front-end tools which would utilize the back-end.


*App setup* We used:
1. IronHack generator for the basic app setup
2. MongoDB Compass to store user/project
3. Cloudinary to post and retrieve users images
4. Heroku app to deploy the app.

*Data models*
There are two data models to represent (1) users and (2) projects. These are linked by the publisher which a user becomes as she/he creates a project.

*User registration and authentication*
We implemented authentication with basic RegEx for emails and Bcrypt for hashing passwords.

*Front-End*
The CSS is a hybrid which contains Bootstrap, CSS classes and imported components.
